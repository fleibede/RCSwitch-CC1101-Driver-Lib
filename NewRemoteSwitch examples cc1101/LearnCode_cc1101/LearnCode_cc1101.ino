/*
 * Demo for RF remote switch receiver. 
 * This example is for the new KaKu / Home Easy type of remotes!
 *
 * For details, see NewRemoteReceiver.h!
 *
 * With this sketch you can control a LED connected to digital pin 13,
 * after the sketch learned the code. After start, the LED starts to blink,
 * until a valid code has been received. The led stops blinking. Now you
 * can control the LED with the remote.
 *
 * Note: only unit-switches are supported in this sketch, no group or dim.
